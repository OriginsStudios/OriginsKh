We also had the pleasure of working with Plume, a Japanese company that wanted to promote its services in Cambodia through a unique and creative approach. Their idea was to advertise on a tuktuk, using a custom-designed vehicle wrap to bring attention to their brand on the busy streets. To support their campaign, Origins Studios produced a complete set of photos and videos that highlighted the design, the brand message, and the lively atmosphere of the city.

Our team carefully planned each scene to capture both the tuktuk’s visual appeal and the energy of its surroundings, blending local culture with Plume’s clean and modern identity. The final results were a series of vibrant, professional visuals that brought their vision to life — and the client was extremely pleased with the outcome.

At Origins Studios, we don’t limit ourselves to indoor studio work. We bring creativity anywhere it’s needed — whether it’s an outdoor location, a product showcase, or a lifestyle campaign. Our team is skilled at adapting to any subject or setting, using lighting, composition, and storytelling to make every project stand out. From polished studio portraits to outdoor brand activations, we deliver visuals that connect with audiences and elevate your brand’s image.
