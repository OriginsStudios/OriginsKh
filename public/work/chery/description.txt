We were thrilled to take on a T-shirt design project for Chery Cambodia, inspired by Vincent van Gogh’s iconic masterpiece, The Starry Night. The challenge was to take the painting’s swirling patterns, vibrant colors, and emotional depth and transform them into a design that works beautifully on apparel — something that feels both artistic and contemporary. Our team carefully considered composition, color balance, and the interplay of shapes to ensure that the final design would be visually striking while still wearable, creating a product that resonates with both art lovers and everyday fashion enthusiasts.

The project was more than just putting a painting on a T-shirt — it was about interpreting the energy, motion, and emotion of Van Gogh’s work in a way that connects with Chery’s brand identity. The result is a unique, expressive piece of merchandise that reflects creativity, imagination, and attention to detail.

This project also demonstrates Origins Studios’ versatility and breadth of expertise. While we are known for photography and video production, we also excel in graphic design and creative merchandising, bringing ideas to life across a wide range of mediums.
